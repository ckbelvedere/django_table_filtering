# django-table-filtering

This is a simple project that explains how to use a generic class based view to filter a table. It is a companion to my answer (the **D** part actually which is the most important) at SO @  http://stackoverflow.com/a/15129259/119071

To find out some more info about the (rather complex) ``filter_ex`` view, check out this post: https://spapas.github.io/2016/09/12/django-split-query/
